# üîê Code Guardian

**Code Guardian** is a Visual Studio Code extension that integrates AI-powered security analysis into your coding workflow. It uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) to analyze JavaScript and TypeScript code for potential security vulnerabilities, bad practices, and insecure coding patterns.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Real-time Analysis**  
  Automatically analyzes the function under your cursor as you type, highlighting potential security issues.

- üìÑ **Full File Analysis**  
  Scan your entire file for security vulnerabilities with a single command.

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**  
  Select code or a line and get an AI-generated security analysis with detailed explanations.

- üí¨ **Interactive Follow-up Q&A**  
  Ask follow-up questions inside a custom webview for deeper insights about detected issues.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Quick Fixes**  
  Apply AI-suggested secure code fixes directly from the editor.

- üß† **Powered by Ollama LLM**  
  Uses local models via Ollama (e.g., `gemma3:1b`) for fast, private code analysis.

- üìù **Markdown-formatted Responses**  
  Clear, beautifully formatted AI responses with syntax highlighting and tips.

## üß™ Usage

### Real-time Analysis

1. Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code.
2. Place your cursor inside a function.
3. The extension will automatically analyze the function and highlight potential security issues.

### Full File Analysis

1. Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code.
2. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) ‚Üí Run `üîç Analyze Full File for Security Issues`.
3. View the diagnostics in the Problems panel and hover over highlighted issues for details.

### AI Analysis of Selected Code

1. Open any file in VS Code.
2. Select a block of code or just place the cursor on a line.
3. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) ‚Üí Run `Analyze with AI Security CO-Pilot`.
4. View the analysis in the webview panel.
5. Ask follow-up questions directly in the UI for deeper insights.

### Applying Quick Fixes

## üß† Models & AI

- Default model: `gemma3:1b` (can be configured to use other Ollama-compatible LLMs)
- Conversation context is retained for better follow-up answers
- The extension uses two AI analysis approaches:
  1. Structured JSON output for editor diagnostics
  2. Markdown-formatted responses for the interactive webview

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can modify the model and other Ollama settings in `src/analyzer.ts`:

```ts
const stream = await ollama.chat({
  model: 'gemma3:1b',
  messages: conversationHistory,
  stream: true
});
```

## üí° Future Ideas

- Support for additional programming languages
- Model selection dropdown in the UI
- Security issue severity scoring and filtering
- Integration with static code analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, Semgrep)
- Multi-file analysis for detecting cross-file vulnerabilities
- Custom security rules and policies
- Offline mode with cached analysis patterns
